I am a PhD Candidate in the [Department of Political Science](https://pol.illinois.edu) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I study comparative politics. 

My dissertation “The Role of Outgroup Trust on Voting Behavior in Ethnically Salient Contexts” is under the supervision of Matthew S. Winters (co-chair), Cara Wong (co-chair), Avital Livny, and Thomas J. Rudolph. It identifies how to mitigate the negative effects of ethnic voting on democratic consolidation by testing whether an increase in trust across ethnic groups can motivate individuals to vote across ethnic lines, in contexts where ethnicity is a salient identity. I argue in my dissertation that the detrimental effect of ethnic voting on democratic consolidation will be less prominent in contexts where individuals extend trust beyond their own ethnic groups (i.e., display high outgroup trust). I test my theory using comparative data from US and Myanmar populations, and existing survey data on sub-Saharan Africa. 

Prior to joining the PhD program at Illinois, I received my BA in International Studies and MA in Global Affairs and Policy from Yonsei University.
