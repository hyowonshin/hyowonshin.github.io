I am a PhD Candidate in the [Department of Political Science](https://pol.illinois.edu) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I study comparative politics. 

My research focuses on inter-ethnic trust and its influence on political behaviors in new democracies, especially Myanmar. My dissertation project seeks to explain variation in voting behavior in ethnically salient contexts with inter-ethnic trust or trust extended beyond one's ethnic group. I hypothesize that individuals with high levels of inter-ethnic trust are less likely to vote for co-ethnic candidates compared to those with low levels of inter-ethnic trust. My dissertation is supported by various sources, including the Schroeder Summer Graduate Fellowship from the Cline Center at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 

My other projects include immigrant incorporation in East Asia and Latin America, and origins of inter-ethnic trust in ethnically salient contexts. 

Prior to joining the PhD program at Illinois, I received my BA in International Studies and MA in Global Affairs and Policy from Yonsei University.
