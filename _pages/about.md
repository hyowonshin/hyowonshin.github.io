I am a PhD Candidate in the [Department of Political Science](https://pol.illinois.edu) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I study comparative politics. 

My dissertation “The Role of Outgroup Trust on Voting Behavior in Ethnically Salient Contexts” is under the supervision of Matthew S. Winters (co-chair), Cara Wong (co-chair), Avital Livny, and Thomas J. Rudolph. It identifies how to mitigate the negative effects of ethnic voting on democratic consolidation by testing whether an increase in trust across ethnic groups can motivate individuals to vote across ethnic lines, in contexts where ethnicity is a salient identity. Previous work finds that voting along ethnic lines can have detrimental effects on democratic consolidation as it can reduce the ex-ante uncertainty of elections, encourage patronage politics, and push candidates to take extreme policy stances leading to polarization. In considering factors that may encourage people to vote across ethnic lines, I turn to social capital. Social trust, one form of social capital, increases individuals’ willingness to cooperate with others, and improves collective action, economic growth, and institutions at the national level. Consequently, higher levels of social trust can facilitate the development of a robust democracy. I argue in my dissertation that the detrimental effect of ethnic voting on democratic consolidation will be less prominent in contexts where individuals extend trust beyond their own ethnic groups (i.e., display high outgroup trust). I propose several mechanisms through which individuals with high levels of outgroup trust will be more likely to vote for a non-co-ethnic candidate in new democracies. These mechanisms highlight the importance of social networks, the reception of information, and collective action. I test my theory using comparative data from US and Myanmar populations, and existing survey data on sub-Saharan Africa. Using both primary and secondary survey and experimental data, I demonstrate that in countries where ethnicity is a salient identity, individuals with higher levels of outgroup trust are more likely to vote for an ethnic outgroup candidate than those with lower levels of outgroup trust. The primary survey experimental data was collected with the support of the University of Illinois’ Robert Ferber and Seymour Sudman Dissertation Awards for Survey Research. By considering how variation in the level of outgroup trust affects voting behavior in contexts where ethnicity is a salient identity, my research contributes to the broader debate on the impact of social attitudes on political behaviors, especially where society is divided along ethnic lines. 

Prior to joining the PhD program at Illinois, I received my BA in International Studies and MA in Global Affairs and Policy from Yonsei University.
